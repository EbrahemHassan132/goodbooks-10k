# Recommender System Project

## Overview
This project involves building a recommender system using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system is designed to predict user ratings for books based on historical rating data and book attributes.

## Project Structure
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes book metadata (such as author, tags) to compute similarity between books and recommend books similar to those a user has liked.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user rating data to identify similar users or items and make recommendations based on the preferences of similar users.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommender-system.git
    cd recommender-system
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Building_the_recommender_system.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Load and preprocess the book metadata and user rating data.
    - Extract relevant features for content-based filtering.

2. **Content-Based Filtering**:
    - Compute the similarity matrix for books using features such as author and tags.
    - Recommend books based on the similarity to books the user has rated highly.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**:
    - Generate rating predictions for books using user-item interactions.
    - Utilize k-nearest neighbors to identify similar users or items.

4. **Testing and Evaluation**:
    - Test the system by generating rating predictions for known and unknown books.
    - Evaluate the performance by comparing predicted ratings with actual ratings.

## Example
An example usage of the system is demonstrated in the notebook. Here are a few steps showcased:
- Generating rating predictions for a user (e.g., user 10) based on their historical data.
- Comparing predicted ratings with actual ratings for validation.
